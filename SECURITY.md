# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not open a public issue for a security vulnerability.**

Report it privately, through either channel:

- **GitHub:** private vulnerability reporting on this repository, at
  <https://github.com/ethereumclassic/core-geth/security/advisories/new>. It is
  enabled and reaches this project's maintainers.
- **Email:** write to <security@ethereumclassic.com>.

Include what you can: the affected version or commit, the network, what an
attacker gains, and a reproduction if you have one. A report without a
reproduction is still worth sending.

With the ETC Cooperative's dissolution, Ethereum Classic stakeholders such as
mining pools, exchanges and service providers should use
<security@ethereumclassic.com> as their point of contact. A person answers it:
one of the core developers who maintain this repository and have been with the
network since its inception.

### What to expect

Reports are acknowledged and triaged privately. Where a fix is warranted it is
prepared under a GitHub security advisory and disclosed once a release carrying
it is available. Reporters are credited unless they ask not to be.

## Security updates and releases

Track this repository's release line,
[`ethereumclassic/core-geth`](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/core-geth/releases).
To follow its security updates and releases:

- **GitHub:** on the repository's main page, open the **Watch** menu, click
  **Custom** and select **Releases**
  ([GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/subscriptions-and-notifications/get-started/configuring-notifications#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository)).
  Published security advisories are listed at
  <https://github.com/ethereumclassic/core-geth/security/advisories>.
- **Email:** write to <security@ethereumclassic.com> to subscribe.

## Automated and AI-assisted review

**Findings from automated or agent-assisted review go through the private channels
above, the same as any other.** Not a public issue, and not a pull request whose
diff describes the defect before a fix exists.

The reason is unchanged by how a finding was produced. What matters is whether it
is exploitable against nodes that are running now, and an automated review can
surface something exploitable as readily as a manual one. Volume does not change
the obligation: a report with fifty findings and one that is real is still a
report that should arrive privately.

Such reviews are welcome. This client carries a large inherited surface, and
systematic review of it is worth more to the project than the noise it costs to
triage.

## Publication and credit

**Once a finding is resolved and a release carrying the fix is available, the
review may be published in [`docs/audits/`](docs/audits/)**, as the March 2026
audit and its August follow-up already are.

That serves two purposes. It gives operators the per-release detail they need to
decide what they are exposed to, and it credits the work by name. Security review
of an under-resourced client is largely unpaid, and the record of who did it
should be public and durable rather than a line in a changelog.

**Our thanks to the white hat community.** Several of the defects closed in this
release series were found and reported by people with no obligation to look. Where
a reporter wants credit they are named; where they prefer not to be, they are not.

## Scope

This repository is Core-Geth, the Ethereum Classic execution client. Consensus
rules, chain configuration, peer-to-peer networking, the JSON-RPC surface, key
handling and the node binaries are all in scope.

Vulnerabilities in other Ethereum Classic software (other clients, explorers,
wallets, bridges or infrastructure) are outside this repository. Report those to
the project that maintains them.

## Core-Geth is a derivative of go-ethereum

A defect here may be inherited from upstream rather than specific to this client.
Where it affects code shared with
[go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum), it is worth reporting
there as well: <https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/security/policy>.

**Neither project forwards reports to the other.** Reporting to both is welcome
and is the right move for a shared defect.

## `geth version-check` checks go-ethereum, not this client

The `version-check` command queries go-ethereum's vulnerability feed at
`geth.ethereum.org` and matches advisories against the running version string.

**That feed does not track Core-Geth**, and Core-Geth's version numbering has
diverged from go-ethereum's, so its output is not meaningful here in either
direction: a `No vulnerabilities found` result says nothing about this client,
and since the match must start at the beginning of the version string,
go-ethereum's advisories, whose patterns begin with `Geth/`, no longer match
this client's `Core-Geth/` version string.

Do not treat that command as a clean bill of health for Core-Geth.
