## Core-Geth: Ethereum Classic Execution Client

> A [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) fork providing the production Ethereum Classic (ETC) execution client.

## ⚠️ Node operators: upgrade to v1.13.0, and rotate your node key

**Every release in the v1.12.x line carries at least one unpatched CVE, and the earliest
carry all six.** They were built on a Go toolchain that reached end of life in August 2024.
Upgrade, then perform the one cleanup step below.

**1. Upgrade, and change where you track releases.** Releases are cut from
[`ethereumclassic/core-geth`](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/core-geth). A node tracking
the previous repository will not see v1.13.0.

**2. Rotate the P2P node key. This is required, not precautionary.** CVE-2026-26315 is an
oracle: an invalid-curve ephemeral key in the RLPx handshake previously reached ECDH and
failed only at MAC verification, which leaks bits of the node key across repeated
handshakes. Any key used by an unpatched node should be treated as exposed.

```bash
# with the node stopped
mv <datadir>/geth/nodekey <datadir>/geth/nodekey.old-rotated-$(date +%F)
```

The client generates a fresh key on the next start. **Your enode ID changes**, so update
every static-peer, trusted-peer or bootnode list that names this node — on your own
machines and with anyone peering with you. Capture the old enode ID before rotating if you
need it to find those references; it cannot be re-derived afterwards.

**3. Re-check your RPC exposure while the node is down.** `--http.addr` should be loopback
unless a trusted proxy sits in front of it, and `admin`, `debug` and `personal` do not
belong in `--http.api` on any reachable interface. `--http.corsdomain="*"` is not a safe
default.

**A resync is not required.** No finding in either audit corrupts chain data, and none is
known to have been exploited against this network. Verify your head matches another source
before concluding otherwise:

```bash
geth attach --exec 'eth.blockNumber' <datadir>/geth.ipc
```

Compare against a block explorer or a second client. Resync only if it diverges — and if it
does, that is a finding worth reporting.

**Nothing here requires touching your keystore.** These are network-layer and handshake
issues; account keys are not implicated by any of them. Rotate account keys only if your
`admin` or `personal` RPC was reachable from an untrusted network, which is its own
exposure rather than one of these CVEs.

Full detail: the [March 2026 audit](docs/audits/2026-03-security-audit.md), the
[August 2026 follow-up](docs/audits/2026-08-security-followup.md), and the
[v1.13.0 migration guide](docs/tutorials/v1.13.0-migration.md).

**The release artifacts were audited separately**, and that one matters before you
download rather than after: the published `v1.12.x` Linux and Arm binaries require a
newer glibc than the systems many operators run, and the macOS archive has contained an
Apple Silicon binary under an architecture-free name since June 2024. See
[release artifacts](docs/audits/2026-09-release-pipeline.md) and
[dependency and toolchain modernization](docs/audits/2026-08-dependency-modernization.md).

Core-Geth is a production execution client for the Ethereum Classic network. It implements every ETC hard fork from Frontier through Spiral.

**Note:** Upstream go-ethereum has removed support for Ethereum Classic, so ETC consensus rules are maintained here rather than inherited.

## Supported Networks

| Network | Chain ID | Consensus | Flag |
|---------|----------|-----------|------|
| Ethereum Classic (ETC) | 61 | Proof of Work (ETChash) | `--classic` |
| Mordor Testnet | 63 | Proof of Work (ETChash) | `--mordor` |
| MintMe.com Coin | 24734 | Proof of Work | `--mintme` |
| Private chains | configurable | PoW / PoA | genesis config |

Ethereum mainnet, Sepolia and Holesky are also registered, inherited from upstream
go-ethereum, and `--mainnet` is still what a bare invocation selects.

**They are not maintained here.** This client implements Ethereum through Cancun
and no further, so a node run on any of them follows the real chain up to the next
fork it does not know about and then continues on its own rules without reporting
anything. Use `--classic` or `--mordor` explicitly.

### ETC consensus history

Activation blocks, governing specifications and included EIPs, aligned with
[ECIP-1066](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1066), which is the network description this table follows. The Mordor
column is client detail and is not part of that specification.

**MESS** (Modified Exponential Subjective Scoring, ECBP-1100) is a chain-selection
defense against deep reorganizations. It is a client-side policy rather than a state
transition, which is why it appears as two rows: the block at which it defaults on, and
the block at which it defaults off.

**Through Spiral — the head configuration this client implements — Ethereum Classic has
not adopted EIP-1559**, so transactions are the legacy and EIP-2930 access-list types.
That is the state of the fork schedule in `params/`, not a permanent property of the
network: adopting it is a protocol decision for Ethereum Classic to make, and a client
question after that.

### Wire protocol

**This client speaks `eth/68`, and that is the version it will serve until it is
retired.** The v1.13 series exists to close the security gap and carry Ethereum Classic
on a supported toolchain while the client is sunset, so it takes no new protocol
version.

`eth/69` (EIP-7642) removes Total Difficulty from the handshake, which this client's
proof-of-work chain selection reads — so adopting it here would mean reworking that path
in a client already scheduled for retirement. **That is a scoping decision about this
client, not a limitation of Ethereum Classic.** `eth/69` is already implemented for
Ethereum Classic in [Fukuii](https://fukuii.org), developed at
[`fukuii-project/fukuii-cli`](https://github.com/fukuii-project/fukuii-cli), and reaches
the network through it and through the Ethereum Classic extensions maintained against
mainstream Ethereum clients.

## Build

```bash
make geth
```

The binary is written to `./build/bin/geth`.

## Test

```bash
# ETC-specific unit tests
go test ./params/... -run TestETC -v
go test ./core/... -run "TestGasLimit|TestECIP1017|TestETCForkCompliance" -v
go test ./consensus/ethash/... -run "TestDifficultyETC|TestDifficultyECIP" -v

# Live-network tests, build-tagged; requires a running Mordor or ETC node
go test -tags live ./tests/live_etc/ -v
```

The consensus fixtures live in three submodules: `tests/testdata`,
`tests/testdata-etc` and `tests/evm-benchmarks`. Run
`git submodule update --init --recursive` before any suite that reads them, or
the failures look like consensus errors rather than missing files.

## Run a node

```bash
./build/bin/geth --classic --datadir <path>     # Ethereum Classic mainnet
./build/bin/geth --mordor  --datadir <path>     # Mordor testnet
```

`--http.addr` defaults to loopback. Do not widen it, enable `--http.corsdomain`, or add
`admin` or `debug` to `--http.api` on a node reachable from an untrusted network.

## Mining

Core-Geth supports Ethash/ETChash proof-of-work mining:

```bash
./build/bin/geth --classic --mine --miner.etherbase <address>
```

For testing with fake PoW, which skips DAG generation:

```bash
./build/bin/geth --classic --mine --miner.etherbase <address> --fakepow
```

## Security

This release backports six CVE fixes from upstream go-ethereum and adds a GraphQL query
depth limit. Each is a separate commit; run `git log --grep CVE-` for the full detail,
including the upstream commit every fix derives from.

| Identifier | Component | Issue |
|-----|-----------|-------|
| CVE-2026-26313 | `eth/protocols` | Unbounded RLP message decoding |
| CVE-2026-26314 | `crypto/secp256k1` | `IsOnCurve` accepted coordinates outside the field |
| CVE-2026-26315 | `crypto/ecies` | Invalid-curve attack on the RLPx handshake |
| CVE-2026-22862 | `crypto/ecies` | Minimum ciphertext length check |
| CVE-2026-22868 | `eth` | Invalid KZG blob proofs |
| CVE-2025-24883 | `crypto` | `UnmarshalPubkey` accepted off-curve points |
| — | `graphql` | Unbounded query depth |

**Rotate P2P node keys after upgrading.** CVE-2026-26315 is an oracle against the node key
itself, so a key used by an unpatched node should be treated as exposed. Stop the node,
remove `<datadir>/geth/nodekey`, and restart; the client generates a new one. The node's
enode ID changes, so update any static-peer or trusted-peer list that names it.

`SECURITY.md` carries the disclosure policy and PGP key.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and fixes of any size are useful. Fork the repository,
make your change, and open a pull request against `main`. For anything
substantial, open an issue first so the approach can be discussed.

[CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) has the coding guidelines, the build
and test commands, and the branch policy.

**If your fix applies to code shared with
[go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) rather than to Ethereum
Classic specifically, please send it upstream as well, or instead.** It reaches
every client built from that source, and it arrives here through the regular
merges.

Security vulnerabilities are not reported as issues. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Project history

The code and the maintaining team have separate lineages, and neither is a
straight line.

**The code.** go-ethereum began in December 2013.
[multi-geth](https://github.com/multi-geth/multi-geth) forked it in March 2018 to
support several networks from a single client, holding chain rules as
configuration rather than as code branches. multi-geth was renamed Core-Geth in
February 2020 and kept that model, which is why a further network here is a chain
configuration rather than a new client.

**The team.** ETC Labs Core formed in December 2018, many of its developers having
previously been part of ETCDEV, which supported the Classic Geth client. As
Classic Geth was retired the team supported multi-geth, and then Core-Geth from
2020. From January 2022 the work was funded by the
[ETC Cooperative](https://etccooperative.org/posts/2021-12-22-coop-now-funding-core-geth).

**This repository** was created on 2024-12-21 from the preceding repository at
commit `7ef3ecd7a` (2024-12-16), and has carried Ethereum Classic's Core-Geth
since. That commit is preserved on the `archive-etclabscore-2024-12` branch and
tagged `archive/etclabscore-2024-12`.
