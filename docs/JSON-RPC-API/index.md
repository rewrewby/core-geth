# Using JSON-RPC APIs

## Programmatically interfacing `geth` nodes

As a developer, sooner rather than later you'll want to start interacting with `geth` and the
Ethereum Classic network via your own programs and not manually through the console. To aid
this, `geth` has built-in support for a JSON-RPC based APIs ([standard APIs](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/)
and `geth` specific APIs; most namespaces have a page of their own in this section).
These can be exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (UNIX sockets on UNIX based
platforms, and named pipes on Windows).

The IPC interface is enabled by default. On Ethereum Classic and Mordor it serves `admin`,
`debug`, `engine`, `eth`, `ethash`, `miner`, `net`, `rpc`, `trace`, `txpool` and `web3`, and
adds the deprecated `personal` namespace only with `--rpc.enabledeprecatedpersonal`. The HTTP
and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled, and due to security reasons they serve only the
namespaces named in `--http.api` and `--ws.api`, plus `rpc`.
An empty list is not an empty set. `--http.api ""` and `--ws.api ""` stop the node at startup,
because an empty list would serve every namespace except `engine`, `admin`, `debug` and
`personal` among them. An empty `HTTPModules` or `WSModules` in a configuration file still does
serve them, so name the namespaces there too.
**`--rpc.enabledeprecatedpersonal` does not gate HTTP or WS:** naming `personal` in
`--http.api` or `--ws.api` serves it there whether or not the flag is set.

HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:

  * `--http` Enable the HTTP-RPC server
  * `--http.addr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--http.port` HTTP-RPC server listening port ([default](../operate/security.md#ports-and-listeners))
  * `--http.api` API's offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--http.corsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests (browser enforced)
  * `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server
  * `--ws.addr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--ws.port` WS-RPC server listening port ([default](../operate/security.md#ports-and-listeners))
  * `--ws.api` API's offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--ws.origins` Origins from which to accept websockets requests
  * `--graphql` Enable GraphQL on the HTTP-RPC server. Note that GraphQL can only be started if an HTTP server is started as well.
  * `--graphql.corsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests (browser enforced)
  * `--graphql.vhosts` Comma separated list of virtual hostnames from which to accept requests (server enforced). Accepts '*' wildcard. (default: "localhost")
  * `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server
  * `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)

You'll need to use your own programming environments' capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to
connect via HTTP, WS or IPC to a `geth` node configured with the above flags and you'll
need to speak [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) on all transports. You
can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!
[OpenRPC discovery](openrpc.md) shows how to ask a running node for its OpenRPC document. The
document can list methods an interface does not serve, such as `personal_*` over IPC without
`--rpc.enabledeprecatedpersonal` and the `trace_filter` subscription, so `rpc_modules` is the check
for which namespaces an interface serves.

!!! Attention

    Please understand the security implications of opening up an HTTP/WS based
    transport before doing so! [RPC exposure](../operate/security.md#rpc-exposure) covers what to
    check first. [Public RPC endpoint](../guides/public-rpc-endpoint.md) covers serving JSON-RPC to
    other people. Hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert
    Ethereum nodes with exposed APIs! Further, all browser tabs can access locally
    running web servers, so malicious web pages could try to subvert locally available
    APIs!
