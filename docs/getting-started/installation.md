title: Installation

There are three ways to get `geth`: download a pre-built archive, build a
Docker image from this source, or build the binary from source. Building from
source is covered on its own page, [Build from Source](../developers/build-from-source.md).

!!! warning "Install from this repository only"
    Core-Geth moved to [`ethereumclassic/core-geth`](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/core-geth).
    Archives and images published under the previous `etclabscore` namespace are
    not built from this source and do not carry the fixes released here. Do not
    install from them.

## Pre-built executable

Binary archives are attached to each tagged release on this repository's
[releases page](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/core-geth/releases). Download the
archive for your platform, verify it against its checksum, unarchive it, and run
the binary.

Each release publishes two archives per platform:

| Archive | Contains |
| --- | --- |
| `core-geth-<platform>-<tag>.zip` | the `geth` node binary alone |
| `core-geth-alltools-<platform>-<tag>.zip` | `geth` plus the other tools built from this source |

`<platform>` is one of:

| Platform | Machine |
| --- | --- |
| `linux` | Linux, x86_64 |
| `osx` | macOS, Intel |
| `osx-arm64` | macOS, Apple Silicon |
| `win64` | Windows, x86_64 |
| `arm64` | Linux, 64-bit ARM |
| `arm5`, `arm6`, `arm7` | Linux, 32-bit ARM, by ARM architecture version |
| `arm` | deprecated; identical to `arm5`. Use `arm5` |

Every archive is published alongside a `.sha256` file. Verify before you run:

```shell
$ sha256sum -c core-geth-linux-v1.13.0.zip.sha256
$ unzip core-geth-linux-v1.13.0.zip
$ ./geth --help
```

On macOS use `shasum -a 256 -c` in place of `sha256sum -c`.

## With Docker

Images are published to the GitHub Container Registry for each tagged release,
built for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`:

```shell
$ docker pull ghcr.io/ethereumclassic/core-geth:latest
```

Tags mirror the release tags. `ghcr.io/ethereumclassic/core-geth:v1.13.0` is a
specific release; `latest` follows the most recent non-prerelease. The image
built from `Dockerfile.alltools`, containing the full tool set rather than the
node alone, is published under the same name with an `alltools-` prefix, as
`ghcr.io/ethereumclassic/core-geth:alltools-latest`.

!!! warning "Images under the previous namespace are not these images"
    Images published as `etclabscore/core-geth` on Docker Hub are not built from
    this source and receive nothing released here.

You can also build an image yourself — the `Dockerfile` produces an image
containing `geth`, and `Dockerfile.alltools` one containing the full tool
set:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/ethereumclassic/core-geth.git
$ cd core-geth
$ docker build -t core-geth .
```

Run it either way. The image's entry point is `geth`, so flags are passed
directly — substitute the published image name for `geth` below to run the
published one:

```shell
$ docker run -d \
    --name core-geth \
    -v $LOCAL_DATADIR:/root \
    -p 30303:30303 -p 30303:30303/udp \
    -p 8545:8545 \
    core-geth \
    --classic \
    --http --http.addr 0.0.0.0 --http.port 8545
```

That maps the devp2p port over both TCP and UDP, keeps chain data in
`$LOCAL_DATADIR` on the host so it survives the container, and exposes the
JSON-RPC endpoint on port 8545.

!!! warning "`--http.addr 0.0.0.0` exposes the RPC endpoint"
    `geth` binds RPC to the loopback interface by default, which inside a
    container means nothing outside it can connect. Setting `--http.addr 0.0.0.0`
    is what makes the endpoint reachable from the host, and it will equally make
    it reachable from anywhere else that can route to the container. Publish the
    port only to where it is needed, and do not expose an RPC endpoint to the
    public internet without putting access control in front of it.

The image also exposes 8546 for the WebSocket endpoint, which needs
`--ws --ws.addr 0.0.0.0` to be served.
