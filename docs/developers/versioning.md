# Versioning

`ethereumclassic/core-geth` uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). The API definition that would demand increments to the major version is basically nil;
it can be expected that a major version bump would be accompanied by an entirely new repository and name.

`VersionMeta` (`params/version.go`) carries the release stage. It advances `unstable` →
`RC1`, `RC2`, … → `stable` as a release is prepared, must never be empty, and is set once
per tag; `geth version` prints it appended to the semantic version, for example
`1.13.0-RC2` for a release candidate. See [Publishing a release](create-new-release.md)
for when each stage is set.
