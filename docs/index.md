# Core-Geth: the Ethereum Classic execution client

> A [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) downstream that keeps chain
> configuration data-driven rather than hard-coded, so one binary serves Ethereum
> Classic, Mordor and private chains.

**Upstream go-ethereum has removed support for Ethereum Classic.** ETC consensus rules
are maintained here rather than inherited, which is what this client is for.

!!! danger "The v1.12.x line is insecure: upgrade to v1.13.0"
    Six CVEs and a GraphQL denial of service are documented against it, one of them
    exploited against Ethereum Classic bootnodes in March 2026.

    | Identifier | Severity | What it allows |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | [CVE-2026-22862](audits/2026-03-security-audit.md#cve-2026-22862-ecies-elliptic-curve-integrated-encryption-scheme-decrypt-ciphertext-length-undercheck) | High | Any peer crashes the node during the RLPx handshake. **Exploited against Ethereum Classic bootnodes, 18 March 2026.** |
    | [CVE-2026-26315](audits/2026-03-security-audit.md#cve-2026-26315-ecies-generateshared-accepts-unvalidated-public-key) | High | Repeated handshakes leak bits of the node's own P2P key |

    | [GraphQL query depth](audits/2026-03-security-audit.md#graphql-query-depth-dos) | Medium | Unbounded GraphQL query nesting; no CVE identifier assigned |

    Every release in the line is also built on Go 1.21, end of life since August
    2024. The [migration guide](tutorials/v1.13.0-migration.md) covers the upgrade,
    the required node-key rotation, and how to roll back.

## Supported networks

| Network | Chain ID | Consensus | Flag |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ethereum Classic | 61 | Proof of Work (Etchash) | `--classic`, `--mainnet` or no flag |
| Mordor testnet | 63 | Proof of Work (Etchash) | `--mordor` |
| MintMe.com Coin | 24734 | Proof of Work | `--mintme` |
| Private chains | configurable | PoW / PoA | genesis configuration |

Ethereum Classic runs every hard fork from Frontier through Spiral. The
[README's consensus table](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/core-geth#etc-consensus-history)
lists each upgrade with its activation block and the EIPs it included; `params/` in the
source is the authority, and a fork schedule recalled from memory is a guess.

**With no network flag, `geth` runs Ethereum Classic mainnet**, and `--mainnet` is the
same as `--classic`. A data directory initialized with a private network's genesis keeps
running that network.

### Networks this client does not support

**Ethereum mainnet, Sepolia and Holesky are not supported.** This client implements
Ethereum upgrades only through Cancun, so it cannot follow any of them. `--ethereum`,
`--sepolia` and `--holesky` are deprecated and refuse to start, rather than start a node
that would fall off its chain.

**MintMe is carried deliberately.** `--mintme` works, and this release includes the
MintMe hardfork enabling PUSH0 and MCOPY. It is scheduled for deprecation in a later
release; it is here so that community has a modernized client to build from rather than
a fork of an abandoned one.

## How long this client is for

**The v1.13 series is the last for Core-Geth.** It exists to close the security gap and
carry Ethereum Classic on a supported Go toolchain while the client is retired, not to
begin a new line of development. Plan on that horizon.

On the wire this client speaks `eth/68`, and that is the version it will serve until it
is retired. Later versions are left to the clients that succeed it:
[Fukuii](https://fukuii.org) is the preferred successor,
and the migration guide's [Fukuii section](tutorials/v1.13.0-migration.md#migrating-to-fukuii)
says when to move to it.

## Where releases come from

Releases are published from
[`ethereumclassic/core-geth`](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/core-geth/releases).
Archives published under the previous `etclabscore` namespace are not built from this
source and do not carry the fixes released here.

## What was audited

Four reports, each measuring a different layer. Together they are the evidence for the
paragraph above. No single one of them answers "what differs".

| Report | What it measures |
| --- | --- |
| [March 2026 security audit](audits/2026-03-security-audit.md) | The six CVEs and the GraphQL denial of service, with the per-release breakdown |
| [August 2026 security follow-up](audits/2026-08-security-followup.md) | `v1.12.23` measured at the tag against the advisory records: what it fixed and what it left open |
| [Dependency and toolchain modernization](audits/2026-08-dependency-modernization.md) | What changed underneath the code between the December 2024 archive and this release: the Go toolchain, 83 modules, the linter |
| [Release artifacts](audits/2026-09-release-pipeline.md) | What the published archives actually contain: platform floors, architectures, provenance |

The first three describe the source. **The last one describes the files you download**,
and the two can disagree: a release is not what the build configuration says it builds.

## Security reporting

Report a security issue privately, never in a public issue: through this repository's
[private advisories](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/core-geth/security/advisories), or by
email to <security@ethereumclassic.com>. To follow security updates and releases, track the
[`ethereumclassic/core-geth` release line](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/core-geth/releases).
[`SECURITY.md`](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/core-geth/blob/main/SECURITY.md) has the
disclosure policy and the details of each channel.

With the ETC Cooperative's dissolution, Ethereum Classic stakeholders such as mining pools,
exchanges and service providers should use <security@ethereumclassic.com> as their point of
contact. A person answers it: one of the core developers who maintain this repository and have
been with the network since its inception.

## Support this work

Maintaining Core-Geth since it moved to the community repository has been unfunded public-goods
work. Mining pools, centralized exchanges, issuers of Ethereum Classic financial products, Etchash
mining hardware manufacturers and large holders all depend on an Ethereum Classic client that
follows the network correctly and receives security fixes promptly. If your operation relies on
Ethereum Classic, please help fund that work with a donation or a retroactive grant. Contact
<donations@ethereumclassic.com>, or donate on any EVM chain.
